  abstract  = {We propose a neural encoder-decoder model with reinforcement learning (NRL) for
	grammatical error correction (GEC). Unlike conventional maximum likelihood
	estimation (MLE), the model directly optimizes towards an objective that
	considers a sentence-level, task-specific evaluation metric, avoiding the
	exposure bias issue in MLE. We demonstrate that NRL outperforms MLE both in
	human and automated evaluation metrics, achieving the state-of- the-art on a
	fluency-oriented GEC corpus.},
