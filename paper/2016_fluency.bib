        abstract = {The field of grammatical error correction (GEC) has
grown substantially in recent years, with research directed at both
evaluation metrics and improved system performance against those metrics.
One unvisited assumption, however, is the reliance of GEC evaluation on
error-coded corpora, which contain specific labeled corrections. We examine
current practices and show that GEC’s reliance on such corpora unnaturally
constrains annotation and automatic evaluation, resulting in (a) sentences
that do not sound acceptable to native speakers and (b) system rankings that
do not correlate with human judgments. In light of this, we propose an
alternate approach that jettisons costly error coding in favor of
unannotated, whole-sentence rewrites. We compare the performance of existing
metrics over different gold-standard annotations, and show that automatic
evaluation with our new annotation scheme has very strong correlation with
expert rankings (ρ = 0.82). As a result, we advocate for a fundamental and
necessary shift in the goal of GEC, from correcting small, labeled error
types, to producing text that has native fluency.},
